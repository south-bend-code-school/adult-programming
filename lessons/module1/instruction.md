## What is coding? (6 min)

REALLY LABOR ON THESE POINTS. WORK AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO PROMOTE THE FOLLOWING IDEAS:
 {: .red}
- Coding is not just for the super elite/talented/intelligent.
- Getting started is hard and confusing but ultimately, we are just playing with Legos (like in the gif).
- Ask them to hang on during the tough parts and they will be shocked as to how much they can build.

Ask the students to open up this link: http://localhost:4000/lessons/module1/lesson.html

### Coding in general
The whole point of this part is to demystify the concept of coding. There is a good chance members of this class believe they are incapable or that somehow coding is a lofty craft they could never engage in.

- It can look a lot of different ways.
  - Web dev, backend, databases, etc.
- Explain how we make think of coding how it happens in the movies
  - The Matrix
  - hacking
  - things flying around the screen
  - typing 1 million miles per hour
- Coding is simply using letters, numbers, and symbols to write instruction for the computer
  - A whole bunch of new terminology
  - A lot of things will feel unfamiliar
  - Just know, just imagine you are that Lego character slowly building up your little world
- These letters, numbers, and symbols are typed into a file (imagine PDF or Word document) and then we open these files in the browser who knows what to do with it.
- Any questions?
